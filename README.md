# **MLOps Architecture with AWS**

## **Overview**  
This project outlines an end-to-end MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) infrastructure on AWS, enabling **high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery** across multiple regions. It incorporates components for **training, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining machine learning models** in production using AWS services.

The architecture follows a **primary-region and secondary-region approach** to ensure fault tolerance and disaster recovery.

---

## **Architecture Breakdown**

### **1. Route 53 for Traffic Routing**  
- **AWS Route 53** serves as the DNS and traffic routing service.  
- It routes requests to the primary and secondary regions using **health checks** and **failover policies** to ensure availability.

---

### **2. Primary Region**  

The primary region hosts the core services for ML workloads:  

#### **a. Network Infrastructure**  
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Provides an isolated network for AWS resources.  
- **Subnets:** Divided into public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for fault tolerance.  

#### **b. Compute Layer**  
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Groups:** Hosts the model-serving endpoints and manages dynamic scaling.  
- **Lambda Functions:** Used for event-driven workflows and lightweight processing tasks.  

#### **c. Container Orchestration**  
- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):** Handles containerized ML workloads and ensures orchestration across nodes.  

#### **d. Storage & Databases**  
- **Amazon S3:** Stores data, artifacts, and ML models.  
- **Primary Database:** A managed database (e.g., Aurora) for storing structured data.

---

### **3. Secondary Region (Disaster Recovery)**  

The secondary region mirrors the primary region to ensure availability during failure. Key components include:  
- Replicated **VPC, Subnets, EKS, and Lambda functions**.  
- **Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR):** Ensures that data and models are replicated from the primary to the secondary region.  
- **Replica Database:** A read replica of the primary database for failover.  

---

### **4. Monitoring & Logging**  
- **Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitors metrics, logs, and alerts for infrastructure and ML models.  
- **AWS CloudTrail:** Tracks API actions for auditing and security compliance.  

---

### **5. CI/CD Pipeline**  
- **AWS CodePipeline** integrates with tools like **GitHub** to automate the CI/CD process.  
- **Model Deployment:** Models are deployed into Amazon EKS clusters or Lambda using automated pipelines.  

---

### **6. On-Premises Integration**  
- The architecture supports **hybrid cloud scenarios** where on-premises environments interact with AWS services.

## **Key Features**  
1. **High Availability:**  
   - Multi-AZ architecture ensures fault tolerance in the primary region.  
   - Cross-region failover enabled via Route 53 and secondary infrastructure.  

2. **Scalability:**  
   - Auto-scaling in EC2 and containerized workloads using EKS.  
   - Lambda provides serverless compute for event-driven tasks.  

3. **Disaster Recovery:**  
   - Secondary region with replicated infrastructure ensures business continuity.  

4. **Automation:**  
   - CI/CD pipelines automate deployment, versioning, and scaling of ML models.  

5. **Monitoring & Security:**  
   - CloudWatch and CloudTrail ensure real-time monitoring, logging, and compliance.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Route 53**: DNS and traffic routing  
- **Amazon VPC**: Network isolation  
- **Amazon EC2**: Compute instances for model serving  
- **Amazon EKS**: Container orchestration for ML workloads  
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for lightweight tasks  
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for data and models  
- **Amazon Aurora**/**RDS**: Managed database for structured data  
- **AWS CloudWatch** & **CloudTrail**: Monitoring and logging  
- **AWS CodePipeline**: CI/CD for automating deployments  

---

## **How to Deploy**  
1. **Provision Infrastructure**  
   - Use **Terraform** or **AWS CloudFormation** templates to provision VPCs, EKS clusters, and supporting infrastructure.  

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**  
   - Connect your GitHub repository to **AWS CodePipeline** for automated builds and deployments.  

3. **Deploy ML Models**  
   - Package and containerize ML models using **Docker**.  
   - Deploy models to Amazon EKS or Lambda.  

4. **Monitor and Scale**  
   - Use **CloudWatch** for monitoring metrics and scaling workloads dynamically.
